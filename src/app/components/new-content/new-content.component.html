  <h4 class="text-sm font-bold mb-3">THE YALE SCHOOL OF ART IS A GRADUATE SCHOOL THAT CONFERS MASTER OF FINE ARTS
    DEGREES IN GRAPHIC DESIGN, PAINTING/PRINTMAKING, PHOTOGRAPHY, AND SCULPTURE</h4>
  <p class="text-[10px] font-light pb-2">Artists and designers of unusual promise and strong motivation are provided
    an educational context in which they can explore the potential of their own talents in the midst of an intense
    critical dialogue. This dialogue is generated by their peers, by distinguished visitors, and by a faculty
    comprised of professional artists of acknowledged accomplishment.</p>
  <p class="text-[10px] font-light pb-2">The graduate student’s primary educational experience at Yale is centered on
    the student’s own studio activity. Supporting this enterprise are the experience, knowledge, and skills gained
    from rigorous, structured courses such as drawing, filmmaking, the relativity of color, and the rich academic
    offerings found throughout Yale. Each student is routinely exposed to many aesthetic positions through encounters
    with faculty members and visitors. The School is devoted not only to the refinement of visual skills, but also to
    the cultivation of the mind. Students must bring creative force and imagination to their own development, for
    these qualities cannot be taught—they can only be stimulated and appreciated.</p>
  <p class="text-[10px] font-light pb-2">The School of Art offers an undergraduate art major for students in Yale
    College (see the bulletin Yale College Programs of Study). In addition, the School’s courses are open to students
    in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and other professional schools of the University, and School of Art
    students may enroll in elective courses in the Graduate School and other professional schools as well as in the
    College with permission.</p>
