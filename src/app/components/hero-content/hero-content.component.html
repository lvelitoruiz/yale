    The Yale School of Art is a graduate school that confers MFAs in Graphic
    Design, Painting/Printmaking, Photography, and Sculpture; and offers
    undergraduate-level art courses to Yale College students. Our website exists
    as an ongoing collaborative experiment in digital publishing and information
    sharing. It functions as a wikiâ€”all members of the School of Art community
    have the ability to add new, and edit most existing content.
