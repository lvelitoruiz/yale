  <p class="text-[10px] font-light pb-2">The degree of Master of Fine Arts is the only degree offered by the School
    of Art. It is conferred by the University upon recommendation of the faculty after successful completion of all
    course work in residence and after a thesis presentation that has been approved by the faculty. It implies
    distinctive achievement on the part of students in studies in the professional area of their choice and
    demonstrated capacity for independent work. The minimum residence requirement is two years. All candidates’ work
    is reviewed by faculty at the end of each term. If the work is not considered satisfactory, the student may not
    be invited back to complete the program (see section on Review and Awards under Academic Regulations in the
    chapter General Information). All degree candidates are expected to be present at the Commencement exercises in
    May unless excused by the dean.</p>
  <p class="text-[10px] font-light pb-2">Course work for the Master of Fine Arts degree carries a minimum of sixty
    credits. The disposition of these credits varies according to the area of study and is agreed upon at the time
    of registration between the student and the student’s faculty adviser.</p>
